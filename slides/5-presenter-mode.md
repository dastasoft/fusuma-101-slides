# Presenter Mode

Fusuma has a Presenter Mode that allows you to put the slides on one screen while viewing the speaker's screen on the other. The speaker screen will contain:

- The speaker notes that you placed on each slide.
- A preview of the last slide and the next slide.
- A timer.
- How many slides are left.

All the tools you would need if you were making a speech.

To activate presenter mode, go to the side menu and click on the screen icon. If the browser has permision to broadcast, a pop-up will appear asking on which screen/device you want to broadcast the slides.
